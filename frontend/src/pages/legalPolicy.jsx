                                Grounds for processing personal data In order to be allowed to process your personal data, there must be a legitimate basis for
                                doing so. In the case of Origin this legitimate basis will be – depending on the type of personal data concerned – performance
                                of an agreement, a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy interests or consent. If you do not provide certain
                                personal data, you may not be allowed to fully benefit from all website functionality.

                                process personal data on our behalf. If we instruct a third party to process personal data on our behalf and we have and retain
                                control over the processing, we will sign a written processing agreement with the third party concerned (the 'processor'). That
                                document will lay down agreements on such points as the objective, the duration and scope of the processing, the retention times
                                and the security measures for the personal data.
